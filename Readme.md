# WheelClock

WheelClock presents a unique approach to visualizing time. Unlike traditional digital clocks that snap from one minute to the next, WheelClock offers a continuous and smooth transition. At any given moment, it not only indicates the current time but also offers a glimpse of the imminent future.

## Features

- Progressive Display: The minute display, for instance, at 12:30:40, will show the number '30' occupying the top third and '31' taking up the bottom two-thirds, reflecting the passage of 40 seconds into the 31st minute.

- Fluid Transitions: Each time unit transitions fluidly into the next, merging the discrete clarity of digital with the continuous flow of analog.

The design seeks to bridge the gap between the crisp precision of digital clocks and the flowing nature of analog ones, offering users a new way to perceive and interact with time.
